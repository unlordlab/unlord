As a DevOps Engineer, my core goal is to build effective relationships between development and sys ops teams. I provide guidance, advice, and collaborate with developers to identify the best solutions and practices. DevOps, to me, is a set of approaches and best practices that bridge the gap between software development and operations.

On a daily basis, I work with a range of technologies, including AWS, Kubernetes (k8s), Helm, GitOps, the Argo family, Terraform, and Linux. However, I recognize that technology is constantly evolving. That's why I'm passionate about sharing fresh knowledge and lending a helping hand to those who need it.

In addition to my work as a DevOps Engineer, I actively contribute to the tech community. I have spoken at the DevOops conference, taught IT courses at [Otus](https://otus.ru/lessons/infrastrukturnaya-platforma-na-osnove-kubernetes/) online school, and written articles on exciting IT technologies and approaches for popular platforms such as [Medium](https://kksudo.medium.com/), [Dzone](https://dzone.com/users/4670608/kk-sudo.html), [HackerNoon](https://hackernoon.com/u/kksudo), and [Habr](https://habr.com/ru/users/kksudo/). I am also the author of IT courses on [SkillFactory school](https://skillfactory.ru/devops-engineer), as I believe in the importance of continuous learning and skill development in the IT field.

As a [Certified Kubernetes Administrator (CKA)](https://www.credly.com/badges/aab758e9-2059-4928-a262-2eeb0b2f4d3f?source=linked_in_profile), I bring expertise and proficiency in managing Kubernetes clusters to ensure efficient container orchestration. The [AWS Certified Solutions Architect - Associate certification](https://www.credly.com/badges/345fd0e0-150a-43d4-ae54-0ffc872e44e4/) validates my expertise in designing and deploying scalable, highly available, and fault-tolerant applications on the AWS platform.

One of the most valuable lessons I've learned through sharing knowledge is that I learn just as much as those I teach. 
I am a proud member of the "I want to know everything" and "I'm happy to share what I've already learned" groups, fostering a culture of curiosity and knowledge exchange.

Together, let's embrace the world of DevOps with love and collaborate towards building innovative and efficient solutions.
